# The agnostic JavaScript

The most advanced course I've made in my whole career up until now

This course will take your JavaScript skills to a whole new level as it did for me while learning the content taught through it, I might even say you'd be applicable for applying one of the FAANG companies after applying what youl'll learn here in real life projects.

## Why should I be interested in this series of courses?

I am assuming a question that goes in your head right now that all o this content is available everywhere on the internet, so what makes my course special or different?

Well, surely the course being in Arabic is a speciality for the western orient, Aside from that, the content taught in this course took over a year and a half of gathering/studying from everywhere I might say.

As well as being a whole series of courses which discusses these topics is a bonus that you don't have to go through the searching adventures I've been through.

Now that's done with, what you'll learn throughout this series of courses?

1. [JavaScript internals](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/01-javascript-internals)

   In this course we will discuss the inner pieces that builds up the JavaScript language, how it's processed, compiled, etc.

2. [Advanced JavaScript concepts](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/02-advanced-javascript-foundation)

   In this course we will walk through the hard concepts of JavaScript, more like the WATS that occur in JavaScript due to its lexical scope and dynamic typing nature.

3. [Deep dive into OOP in JS](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/03-advanced-oop-and-prototypes)

   Here we will learn the internal building blocks of the object oriented programming model in JavaScript and how the `class` keyword works under the hood.

4. [Object oriented design](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/04-solid-and-design-patterns)

   After learning OOP the right way and the hard parts in JavaScript's OOP model, let's learn how to design our objects properly using the famous solid principles and design patterns

5. [Data structures and algorithms](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/05-data-structures-and-algorithms)

   You've already learnt a lot of things, but there is more yet to come, now let's get beasty and talk about the most feared topic in computer science, how to structure your data using the well known data structures like the Graph, Binary Tree, Heap etc.

   And also how to operate against these data structures using the famous algorithms like MergeSort, BinarySearch, BubbleSort etc.

6. [Functional programming](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/06-functional-programming-using-javascript)

   This one is my favourite to be honest, in this course you'll have a whole different mind set of programming as you'll be learning a lot of new techniques and new concepts in JavaScript

7. [Advacned asynchronous JavaScript](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/07-advanced-asynchronous-javascript)

   Up untill now we've been all talking about synchronous operations in JS, let's start talking about the advanced parts in async javascript

8. [Reactive programming](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/08-reactive-programming-using-rxjs)

   And finally, my second favourite course, in this one we'll implement most of what we learnt from asynchronousity and functional programming in what's called Rx.js and Observeables

9. [Testing JavaScript](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/09-testing-in-javascript)

   The previous courses were all building blocks to make your understanding of JavaScript more robust, this one is to solidify what you learnt by testing it and learning new techniques for testing your applications whether they're in node.js or react.js

10. [JavaScript performance](https://github.com/ahmedosama-st/the-agnostic-javascript/tree/master/10-javascript-performance)

    The finale of our path, how to measure your application's performance and if a problem occurs how to solve it in a performant way.

I bet all my money on you being thrilled with this enormous content you'll learn in this course, Don't worry, I was there too ðŸ˜„

I wasn't exaggerating when I said that this content would make you applicable to work in one of the FANNG companies, cause in fact, all this content I learned from people working in almost every famous company you can mention: LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon, and a lot other companies.

The only missing step would be - as I said earlier - to dig deeper in the framework you're using whether it's Node.js or React.js (Hint hint, we'll have dedicated courses where we dig deeper in Node.js and React.js) and try to implement what you've learned here in your applications.

So, I hope you a happy journey learning these course ^^
