This repository is made to be your guide during the course and your reference after finishing it as it will contain each file used in any lecture in `.js` and `.ts` versions (if possible)

If you'd like additionally to contribute financially towards the effort (or any of my other work) aside from purchasing the course, I do have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sectheater) that I would always appreciate your generosity towards.
